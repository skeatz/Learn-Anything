3. **Introduction to IoT**
   - **Talk**: 1 hr event (30-min talk, 15-min Q&A. Overview, demo of IoT, use cases, Q&A)
   - **Synopsis**:
   - **Workshop**: 3 hr (Configure & program your own IoT system)
   - **Synopsis**:
4. **Prototyping for Product Design**
   - **Workshop**: 3 hr (Prototyping with Cardboard & Foam)
   - **Synopsis**: Cardboard and foam for prototyping presents 3 big advantages - it's cheap, sturdy and (in the case of cardboard) recyclable. It is one of the most practical skills you can learn for designing products. Almost free, easy to find, easy to manipulate and also super fun. Join us for a 3-hr hands-on workshop on learn the different techniques using cardboard and foam to make beautiful prototypes of your products.
5. **Introduction to Robotics**
   - **Workshop**: Design and Program Your Own Working Robot
     - BBC Microbit-based: 3 hr 
     - Raspberry Pi Pico-based: 3 hr
   - **Synopsis**: Join us for a 3-hr hands-on workshop where you will learn to design, build and program your own working robot using the micropython programming language. Participants will design, fabricate and assemble their own robot chassis, attach motors and sensors to the chassis that they have built, then program their robot to perform different tasks.
6. **Reverse Engineering Product Design**
   - **Talk**: 1 hr event (30-min talk, 15-min Q&A), external (FreeForm?) 
   - **Synopsis**: Reverse engineering a a process by which the design of a product is analyzed or recreated using  a physical part as a starting point. Reverse  engineering can become a valuable solution for extracting the dimensions of handmade models or prototypes, especially with freeform shapes. You could also acquire the 3D geometry of an existing object in order to incorporate some of its features in the new product design. This talk looks at the practice and process of reverse engineering in the product design cycle.
7. **Block Chain and Crypto-currency**
   - **Talk**: 1 hr event (30-min talk, 15-min Q&A), external
   - **Synopsis**:
8. **Introduction to AI and Machine Learning**
   - **Talk**: 1 hr event (30-min talk, 15-min Q&A), external
   - **Synopsis**:
