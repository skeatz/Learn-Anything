## Digital Fabrication

- [Digital Fabrication is MORE than 3D Printing](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/digital-fabrication)
- [How to Make Almost Anything](http://cba.mit.edu/docs/papers/12.09.FA.pdf)

## [Digital Modeling & Fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_modeling_and_fabrication)

- design and production process that combines
  - 3D modeling or Computer Aided Design with
  - additive manufacturing
  - subtractive manufacturing
  - other technologies
- to physically produce the designed objects

## [Opendesk definition](https://www.opendesk.cc/about/digital-fabrication)

- a type of manufacturing process where machine is controlled by a computer
- the most common forms:
  - **CNC Machining**: typically shapes cut out of sheets or blocks of material
  - **3D Printing**: objects are built up out of layers of metal or plastic
  - **Laser Cutting**: material (wood, metal or plastic) are burnt or melted by a laser
- machines can reliably be programmed to make consistent products from digital designs
- Digital fabrication is **turning data into objects** (and **objects into data**)



# Why is Digital Fabrication Important?

## [Digital fabrication is the future](https://www.barbourproductsearch.info/is-digital-fabrication-the-future-blog000295.html#)

- digital fabrication offers a vast array of benefits for both manufacturers and customers
- faster and cheaper process:
  - business owners save time and money
  - savings passed down to customer
  - encourages creativity and customization
  - personalized  vs mass production

## [What do people learn from using digital fabrication tools](https://fablearn.stanford.edu/fellows/blog/what-do-people-learn-using-digital-fabrication-tools)

- merging of human with technical
- students develop multiple skills:
  - growing proficiency with 2D and 3D design
  - spatial development
  - STEAM literacy
  - strengthening critical thinking
  - promotes curiosity-driven, self-directed creative learning
- Skills-based learning that occurs in digital fabrication

![skills-based learning in digital fabrication](fablearn-dfskills.png)



- Real-world skills with applications in engineering, art, design, science, computer science and math
- culture of Makerspace helps students become independent learners, driven by curiosity and intrinsic motivation:
  - I can teach myself to do this
  - I can seek help to troubleshoot problems
  - I can teach others to do this
  - I can solve new problems
  - Learning is not a one-time thing
  - I can tackle increasingly complex problems
  - It is okay to go on a tangent with your learning
  - The more I learn, the more questions I have
  - I can learn my way

## [Technology & the future of ASEAN jobs](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/en_sg/assets/csr/pdf/technology-and-the-future-of-asean-jobs.pdf)

- 6.6 million jobs will become redundant through more widespread adoption of technology by 2028
- 28 million fewer workers (> 10% of current ASEAN-6 workforce) will be required to produce the same level of output as today
- "Reskilling challenge" due to displaced and disrupted workforce
- Technology will create new jobs across the region
- 65% of children entering primary school today will have jobs that do not yet exist and for which their education will fail to prepare them, exacerbating skills gaps and underemployment
- Today's active workforce of 3 billion people is also not able to adjust promptly, due to under-developed adult training and skilling systems

## ASEAN Regional Fablab Network

### Background

- SE Asia has combined population of 690 million people, majority living in rural, under-served communities
- By making knowledge & technologies available, fablabs promote democratized access to innovation and entrepreneurship, reducing the inequality gap
- Setting up an ASEAN Regional Fablab Network, consisting of many local/community fablabs, supported by standard fablabs and a superfablab will allow us to:
  - provide bridge between fablabs, industry and community
  - share best practices
  - foster innovation, co-creation and entrepreneurship
  - supports poverty reduction and closes inequality gap
  - empowers disadvantaged individuals and communities

### Fablabs Impacting Local Communities

- Vigyan Ashram (India): work centric education, enterprise development, rural technology
- Fablab Bohol (Philippines): plastic recycling into products, souvenirs using local materials
- Fablab la Campana (Mexico): empowering marginalized community through STEAM-rich making and learning
- Greenlab Microfactory (Nigeria): open-source solar power for community, STEM education
- Fablab Nairobi (Kenya): design & build medical devices for Kenyatta National Hospital - phototherapy machine, patient monitor, vacuum delivery machine, infant incubator, etc.

### Fablabs and UN SDG

- importance of science and technology in helping to achieve SDGs
- key principles of 2030 Agenda:
  - Ensuring that no one is left behind
  - technology gaps between countries and groups is an issue of concern
  - new technologies, e.g. big data, IoT, 3D printing, digital fabrication, digital automation widens existing inequalities
